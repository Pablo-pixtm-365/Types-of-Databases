## Preface
We recently had a video conference with a friend of our professor Juan vazquez named Paco Ocampo, Paco is a person who knows about managing the cloud for big data and this time he told us about the different types of databases that we can find in the google cloud.

Although databases are essential today for any public and private company, why? This is due to the fact that they are more efficient when storing information (without papers) and less contamination, but without a doubt one of their main advantages of using them is the great value that we can obtain from them, as we usually hear "When life hands you lemons, make lemonade. ", with the data we can even predict the future.

But if you want to know about databases you can search for pages, documents, books among other types of resources, that is why in this document we will focus on the different types of databases that currently exist, we hope you like it .


## Document databases

This type of database is built similar to a JSON file,
XML & YAML or binary formats such as BSON so if we have knowledge of this type of document either because we program in JavaScript or use them to build data frames in python with the help of pandas.

> Here is an example of what the format would look like:

This type is one of the most popular alternatives that can be used as rational tabular databases and according to Wikipedia they constitute one of the main subcategories within the so-called NoSQL databases.

Some characteristics that we will talk about later are the following:

> Natural and flexible 

> They promise higher developer productivity, and faster evolution with application needs.

Here some examples of systems of Document Databases

## Ledger Database.

"Ledger Database — A NoSQL database that provides an immutable, transparent, and cryptographically verifiable transaction log •owned by a central authority. — Amazon’s QLDB Overview"

"A non ledger database is table-centric. A ledger database is log-centric. The log is the database."

To begin with:
* it is not a NoSQL database (usually)
This is different from the usually NoSQL database we're getting, it's different form Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle, MYSQL servers.
Data is stored as a document without and natural relationships to other documents, but in this case this works as a relational database. 

## Flexible Scheme:
